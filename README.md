The aim of the analysis is to track flies climbing the walls on the inside of a transparent tube and measure their speed. A video is recorded with a mobile phone and the analysis is performed in Fiji. The workflow contains three parts: 
1. Video conversion from .mov to a sequence of tiff files. 
2. Pre-processing of the video. 
3. Tracking of the flies using Trackmate.
